# flakeOps

This repository contains experimental configuration for installing and configuring Nix systems. Currently we use it to configure a Raspberry Pi K3s managed by NixOS and our x86 server in Niedernhausen. The main goal is to create a maintainable GitOps approach for a fleet of servers and use cachix for caching and deploying on updates.

With the help of github actions, this should result in local systems that require very little manual maintenance.
