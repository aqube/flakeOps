# flakeOps

> [!NOTE]
> This repo contains the declarative configuration of aqube's on-premise infrastructure. We are still adopting the Nix ecosystem and this repository is a work in progress. We are happy to receive feedback and suggestions.

## Introduction

We started to play around with parts of the Nix ecosystem in early 2024 as an alternative to our more CNCF oriented configuration management. Till then, we used a combination of Ansible, Terraform a lot of scripting and GitOps for hard- and software deployments. Something that's hard to maintain and not as declarative as we would like it to be.

As we are already heavily invested in GitOps for our K8s clusters and customer projects, we wanted to extend this to our on-premise infrastructure as well. The additional benefit of using Nix for development environments and our workstations was a nice side effect.

With the help of github actions for automatic dependency updates, builds and deployments, this should result in local systems that require very little manual maintenance.

## Inputs and Tools
We use a couple of upstream inputs and tools for our flake. The main ones are:

- [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) for `$HOME` directory management as module for NixOs or nix-darwin.
- [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix) to encrypt the few static secrets we need for our deployments. Usually we use a combination of [1password](https://1password.com/) products for dynamic secrets.
- Cachix tools:
  - [cachix-action](https://github.com/cachix/cachix-action) to store our outputs in a public `aqube` binary cache.
  - [cachix-deploy-flake](https://github.com/cachix/cachix-deploy-flake) to generate a `cachix-deploy.json` for all our [cachix-deploy](https://docs.cachix.org/deploy/) agents.
  - [pre-commit-hooks](https://github.com/cachix/pre-commit-hooks.nix) to integrate pre-commit-hooks with flake.

### Under Consideration
- [nix-fast-build](https://github.com/Mic92/nix-fast-build) to speed up the build process on the CI. More useful if we start to build more configurations for different systems. (MultiArch)
- [nixos-generators](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-generators) to generate Images for our Raspberry Pi's and other devices (RISC-V).
- [flake-utils](https://github.com/numtide/flake-utils) or [flake-utils-plus](https://github.com/gytis-ivaskevicius/flake-utils-plus) to simplify multi-arch builds. But we would need to test how it works in combination with cachix-deploy.
- [flake-parts](https://github.com/hercules-ci/flake-parts) to split our flake into smaller parts. This would make it easier to maintain and test the different parts of our infrastructure.
- [snowfall lib](https://github.com/snowfallorg/lib) - opinionated library for flakes. Looks like a clean way to structure a flake repository and avoid writing boilerplate code.
- [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) to use direnv with nix. This would make it easier to work with this repository by automatically activating a devshell with all required tools.

# üíª Development

## üöÄ Add a new Device
1. For Raspberry Pis follow the [install and setup instructions](./docs/raspberry-pi.md).

## DevShell

The flake in this repository provides a configured [development environment](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell#nix_develop) that can be started with `nix develop`. 
The environments are also built on Github Actions for different hostsystems and pushed to `aqube.cachix.org`, this way starting shells is fast and easy.

Because the development environment contains custom scripts, required packages and pre-configured git hooks, it's recommended to use the development environment for all development tasks.

### Automatic Activation

The [.envrc](./.envrc) file contains the configuration for [direnv](https://direnv.net/). This way, the development environment is automatically activated when entering the repository folder. This also requires the [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) package, that provides further local caching and better integration with nix flakes.
An additional feature of direnv is the local execution of your own, configured shell environment and not an empty bash shell.

To enable direnv, you need to run `direnv allow` once.

## üîê Secrets

We use [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix) to encrypt secrets. This allows us to use sops for secrets management, including all available backends. The access configuration is configured in the [.sops.yaml](./.sops.yaml) file. The secrets are stored in the [secrets](./secrets) directory.

Because we also store the secrets encrypted in the repository, it's then also encrypted in the cachix binary cache. This way, we can use the secrets in the deployment process without exposing them.

### Add a new secret
1. If the target host is new, generate a age-key for it. If possible from an existing ssh-key.
    ```bash
    nix-shell -p ssh-to-age --run 'cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub | ssh-to-age'
    ```
2. Add the key to the encryption configuration in the `.sops.yaml` file and re-encrypt all secrets with the new keys. This can be done with the provided nix-app `sops-updatekeys`.
    ```bash
    nix run .#sops-updatekeys
    ```
3. Create a new secret file in the [secrets](./secrets) directory and encrypt it.
4. Add the secret to a host configuration. This requires a module configuration for the `sops-nix` options. We often create a age-key for the host from the host's ssh-key. This way, we can use the host's ssh-key to decrypt the secrets. If that's the case, add the `sops.age.sshKeyPaths` to the host configuration. Secrets are then defined in the `secrets` attribute. Be careful to use `/` as separators for the specific secrets path and **not** a `.` like in yaml syntax! The secret will then be available in a file on the host at `/run/secrets/<secret-path>`. 

    Example:

    ```nix
        sops = {
            defaultSopsFile = ../../../secrets/<secret-file-name>.<extension>;
            age.sshKeyPaths = [ "/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key" ];
            secrets."k3s/server/token" = { };
        };
    ```
